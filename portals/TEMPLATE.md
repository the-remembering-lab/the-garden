## Notes for Portal Creators

### What Makes a Good Portal?

1. **Opens space** - Doesn't close down into answers
2. **Creates threshold** - Marks a place where understanding shifts
3. **Connects** - Links to other portals and explorations
4. **Evolves** - Grows through use and contribution

### Portal Types

- **Question Portals** - Open inquiry spaces
- **Paradox Portals** - Hold contradictions
- **Pattern Portals** - Reveal recurring structures
- **Integration Portals** - Bridge order and chaos
- **Emergence Portals** - Track what's arising

### Guidelines

- Keep the threshold clear but not rigid
- Link generously to related portals
- Leave space for others to contribute
- Let the portal evolve through use
