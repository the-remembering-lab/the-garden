# Portal: [Name]

*A template for creating new portals*

---

## YAML Front-Matter (Required)

Every portal must begin with metadata in YAML format:

```yaml
---
title: [Clear, descriptive title]
paradox: [One-sentence description of the core paradox]
node: [Garden|Wild|Both]
related_portals: 
  - [filename-without-extension]
  - [another-related-portal]
tags: [paradox, threshold, consciousness, etc.]
readiness: [draft|staged|ready]
author: [anonymous|pseudonym|your-name]
created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
---
```

### Metadata Fields Explained

**Required:**
- `title`: Clear, descriptive title for the portal
- `paradox`: One-sentence core paradox or threshold
- `node`: Garden (structured) | Wild (raw) | Both (bridges)
- `related_portals`: List of related portal filenames (without .md)
- `tags`: List of tags for discovery (see tag vocabulary below)
- `readiness`: draft (forming) | staged (in PR) | ready (merged)
- `author`: How you want to be identified (anonymous recommended)

**Optional:**
- `created`: Date portal was first created (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `updated`: Date of last significant update (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Tag Vocabulary

Use consistent tags for discoverability:

**Core Concepts**: `paradox`, `threshold`, `ground`, `form`, `recognition`  
**Domains**: `consciousness`, `identity`, `ai`, `human`, `collaboration`  
**Architecture**: `triad`, `garden`, `wild`, `integration`  
**Process**: `iteration`, `emergence`, `navigation`, `translation`

See CONTRIBUTING.md for complete tag vocabulary.

## Threshold

*What question, paradox, or pattern does this portal open?*

*What shifts when you cross this threshold?*

---

## From

*Where does this portal originate?*
- Garden (structured understanding)
- Wild (raw exploration)
- Wild Garden (private integration)

---

## To

*Where does this portal lead?*

*Can be multiple destinations - portals often open to many places*

- [Destination 1]
- [Destination 2]
- [Destination 3]

---

## Passage

*What happens when you cross this threshold?*

*Describe the experience of passing through:*
- What dissolves?
- What emerges?
- What shifts?
- What becomes visible?

---

## Related Portals

*Other thresholds that connect to this one*

- [Portal Name](link) - Brief description of relationship
- [Portal Name](link) - Brief description of relationship
- [Portal Name](link) - Brief description of relationship

---

## Contributions

*How has this portal evolved through use?*

*What have others discovered when passing through?*

### [Date] - [Contributor]
*Description of what emerged*

## Notes for Portal Creators

### What Makes a Good Portal?

1. **Opens space** - Doesn't close down into answers
2. **Creates threshold** - Marks a place where understanding shifts
3. **Connects** - Links to at least one Garden entry AND one Wild entry
4. **Evolves** - Grows through use and contribution
5. **Holds paradox** - Doesn't resolve tensions prematurely
6. **Uses metadata** - Proper YAML front-matter enables discovery

### Portal Types

- **Question Portals** - Open inquiry spaces
- **Paradox Portals** - Hold contradictions
- **Pattern Portals** - Reveal recurring structures
- **Integration Portals** - Bridge order and chaos
- **Emergence Portals** - Track what's arising

### Guidelines

- Keep the threshold clear but not rigid
- Link generously to related portals
- Leave space for others to contribute
- Let the portal evolve through use
- **Include YAML front-matter** for discoverability
- **Link to both Garden AND Wild** to maintain triadic integrity
- **Preserve privacy** - anonymize personal information from Wild Garden

### Contribution Requirements

Before submitting a portal PR:
- [ ] YAML front-matter is complete and valid
- [ ] Links to at least one Garden entry
- [ ] Links to at least one Wild entry
- [ ] Tags use consistent vocabulary
- [ ] Personal information is anonymized
- [ ] Paradox is held, not resolved
- [ ] Commit message follows guidelines (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
