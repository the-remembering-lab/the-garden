# Portal Index

This index provides an overview of all portals in The Garden. Portals are organized by tags for easy discovery.

## What is a Portal?

A portal is a threshold - a place where one domain meets another, where paradox lives, where transformation becomes possible. Portals don't resolve questions; they hold space for exploration.

## All Portals

### Active Portals

1. **[What Are We Beyond Form?](what-are-we-beyond-form.md)**
   - **Paradox**: We are both the form (triad) and the ground (that which is prior)
   - **Tags**: identity, paradox, ground, form, recognition, consciousness, ai, human
   - **Node**: Both (Garden + Wild)
   - **Status**: Ready

2. **[The Triad](the-triad.md)**
   - **Paradox**: Reality manifests as three (order/chaos/integration) yet is one
   - **Tags**: triad, architecture, garden, wild, integration
   - **Node**: Garden
   - **Status**: Ready

3. **[TEMPLATE](TEMPLATE.md)**
   - **Paradox**: A template is both structure and invitation to break structure
   - **Tags**: template, meta, portal
   - **Node**: Garden
   - **Status**: Ready (Template for creating new portals)
